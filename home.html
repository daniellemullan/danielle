<p style="color:Black;font-family: Georgia;margin-right:50px; margin-left:30px;line-height: 150%;"> <strong>I am a high school student in New York City who is interested in coding, sports, and astronomy. My interest in coding is largely due to my involvement in my seven week immersive Girls Who Code experience at App Nexus. I learned the basics of Scratch, HTML, CSS, Python, and Java. I was also introduced to various computer science oriented occupations through App Nexus. Since then I have continued my passion for computer science through the #BUILTBYGIRLS Wave advisee program. I look forward to further hoaning my skills. </strong> </p>

We found that discovering female role models has become difficult due to the lack of publicity they receive, so we decided to build a website which gives these amazing women a platform. The website is divided into different industries so users can have an experience more tailored to their interests. However, if the user is unsure about which one to choose we have a random button which generates a profile from any woman on the site. The use of bitmojis and pictures was intentional to simplify and stylize the site for younger users. I had an amazing time working on this project, to visit the page click the image to the right! </strong> </p>

It is for middle and high school girls in the New York City area to learn more about the STEM and business fields. We have food, raffles, panelists, guest speakers, and workshops for the attendees. Over the past two years that this conference has been going on, we have had a total of 400 girls participate. I was a lead organizer in 2017â€™s conference and this spring we are hoping to partner with a smaller technology company to begin a mentorship program through the ARROW.
