<p style="color:#12479C;font-family: Georgia;margin-right:35px;">I am a high school student in New York City who is interested in coding, sports, and astronomy. My interest in coding is largely due to my involvement in my seven week immersive Girls Who Code experience at App Nexus. I learned the basics of Scratch, HTML, CSS, Python, and Java. I was also introduced to various computer science oriented occupations through App Nexus. Since then I have continued my passion for computer science through the #BUILTBYGIRLS Wave advisee program. I look forward to further hoaning my skills. </p>

                <p style="color:#12479C;font-family: Georgia> The Truth Behind Us: This was my final project for Girls Who Code. My group and I created a website which allows for users to discover women role models in a various fields. We noticed that oftentimes women are not given the same amount of recognition as men and are therefore often overlooked. The goal of our website is to give these women a platform and to help younger girls discover women to motivate them. We coded this website on github and used HTML/CSS and Java.Click the picture above to go to the website! </p>
