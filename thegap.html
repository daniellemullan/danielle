<p style="color:Black;font-family: Georgia;margin-right:50px; margin-left:30px;line-height: 150%;">The Opportunity Gap refers to the ways in which race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, English proficiency, community wealth, familial situations, or other factors contribute to or perpetuate lower educational aspirations, achievement, and attainment for certain groups of students. </p>

                 factors the lead to a growing oppurtunity gap

                 <p style="color:Black;font-family: Georgia;"> <h2>
                 <li>Students from lower-income households may not have the financial resources that give students from higher-income households an advantage when it comes to performing well in school, scoring high on standardized tests, and aspiring to and succeeding in college. </li>
                <br> <br>
               <li> Minority students may be subject to prejudice or bias that denies them equal and equitable access to learning opportunities. </li>
               <br><br>
               <li> Students raised by parents who have not earned a college degree or who may not value postsecondary education may lack the familial encouragement and support available to other students. These students may not be encouraged to take college-preparatory courses, for example, or their parents may struggle with the complexities of navigating the college-admissions and financial-aid process.</li>

We found that discovering female role models has become difficult due to the lack of publicity they receive, so we decided to build a website which gives these amazing women a platform. The website is divided into different industries so users can have an experience more tailored to their interests. However, if the user is unsure about which one to choose we have a random button which generates a profile from any woman on the site. The use of bitmojis and pictures was intentional to simplify and stylize the site for younger users. I had an amazing time working on this project, to visit the page click the image to the right! </strong> </p>

It is for middle and high school girls in the New York City area to learn more about the STEM and business fields. We have food, raffles, panelists, guest speakers, and workshops for the attendees. Over the past two years that this conference has been going on, we have had a total of 400 girls participate. I was a lead organizer in 2017â€™s conference and this spring we are hoping to partner with a smaller technology company to begin a mentorship program through ARROW.
